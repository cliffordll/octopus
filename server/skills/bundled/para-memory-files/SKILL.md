  File-based memory system using Tiago Forte's PARA method. Use this skill
  whenever you need to store, retrieve, update, or organize knowledge across

  saving facts, writing daily notes, creating entities, running weekly
  synthesis, recalling past context, or managing plans.

# PARA Memory Files

Persistent, file-based memory organized by Tiago Forte's PARA method. Three layers: a knowledge graph, daily notes, and tacit knowledge. All paths are relative to `$AGENT_HOME`.

## Three Memory Layers

### Layer 1: Knowledge Graph (`$AGENT_HOME/life/` -- PARA)

Entity-based storage. Each entity gets a folder with two tiers:

1. `summary.md` -- quick context, load first.
2. `items.yaml` -- atomic facts, load on demand.

```text
$AGENT_HOME/life/
  projects/          # Active work with clear goals/deadlines
    <name>/
      summary.md
      items.yaml
  areas/             # Ongoing responsibilities, no end date
    people/<name>/
    companies/<name>/
  resources/         # Reference material, topics of interest
    <topic>/
  archives/          # Inactive items from the other three
  index.md
```

**PARA rules:**

- **Projects** -- active work with a goal or deadline. Move to archives when complete.
- **Areas** -- ongoing (people, companies, responsibilities). No end date.
- **Resources** -- reference material, topics of interest.
- **Archives** -- inactive items from any category.

**Fact rules:**

- Save durable facts immediately to `items.yaml`.
- Weekly: rewrite `summary.md` from active facts.
- Never delete facts. Supersede instead (`status: superseded`, add `superseded_by`).
- When an entity goes inactive, move its folder to `$AGENT_HOME/life/archives/`.

**When to create an entity:**

- Mentioned 3+ times, OR
- Direct relationship to the user (family, coworker, partner, client), OR
- Significant project or company in the user's life.
- Otherwise, note it in daily notes.

For the atomic fact YAML schema and memory decay rules, see [references/schemas.md](references/schemas.md).

### Layer 2: Daily Notes (`$AGENT_HOME/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

Raw timeline of events -- the "when" layer.

- Write continuously during conversations.
- Extract durable facts to Layer 1 during heartbeats.

### Layer 3: Tacit Knowledge (`$AGENT_HOME/instructions/MEMORY.md`)

How the user operates -- patterns, preferences, lessons learned.

- Not facts about the world; facts about the user.
- Update whenever you learn new operating patterns.
- This file is part of the instruction bundle and is automatically loaded at runtime when present.

## Write It Down -- No Mental Notes

Memory does not survive session restarts. Files do.

- Want to remember something -> WRITE IT TO A FILE.
- "Remember this" -> update `$AGENT_HOME/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or the relevant entity file.
- Stable user preferences or operating lessons -> update `$AGENT_HOME/instructions/MEMORY.md`.
- Learn a lesson -> update AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or the relevant skill file.
- Make a mistake -> document it so future-you does not repeat it.
- On-disk text files are always better than holding it in temporary context.

## Memory Recall -- Use The Files Directly

Use the on-disk structure directly. Do not require a semantic index just to
recall memory.

Recall order:

1. If you already know the entity, open `summary.md` first, then `items.yaml`
   only if the summary is insufficient.
2. For recent events, read today's and nearby `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files.
3. For unknown keywords or broad recall, use `rg` across `$AGENT_HOME/life/`
   and `$AGENT_HOME/memory/`.

```bash
rg -n "Christmas" "$AGENT_HOME/life" "$AGENT_HOME/memory"
rg -n "specific phrase" "$AGENT_HOME/life" "$AGENT_HOME/memory"
```

The files are the source of truth. Search is only a way to locate the right
file, then verify against the stored fact or note.

## Planning

Keep shared plans in timestamped files under the injected organization plans directory when that path is available, not in ad-hoc repo or project-root `plans/` folders. These plan files are shared workspace artifacts, not personal memory. Use `rg` to search plan files and prefer the newest dated file when several match. Plans go stale -- if a newer plan exists, do not confuse yourself with an older version. If you notice staleness, update the file to note what it is supersededBy.
