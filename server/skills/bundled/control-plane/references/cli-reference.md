# octopus agent CLI Reference

Stable CLI contract for agents using the bundled `control-plane` skill. Prefer these commands over direct `/api` calls.

## Defaults

- All commands support `--json`.
- `--org-id` defaults to `OCTOPUS_ORG_ID` when relevant.
- `--run-id` defaults to `OCTOPUS_RUN_ID` and is attached to mutating requests when available.
- `issue checkout` defaults `--agent-id` from `OCTOPUS_AGENT_ID` and defaults `--expected-status` to `todo` and `in_progress`.

## JSON Output Contract

`octopus ... --json` commands must write valid JSON to stdout on success. If a command cannot produce the requested JSON, it must exit nonzero and write a diagnostic error to stderr. An exit-0 command with empty stdout is a CLI/runtime defect, not a valid empty result.

Direct API fallback is allowed for heartbeat close-out only when a required CLI command fails diagnostically or returns exit 0 with empty stdout. When using fallback, note the affected command and reason in the issue comment or run notes so the CLI path can be fixed.

## Issue Close-Out Signals

Before a successful `todo` or `in_progress` issue run exits, leave one close-out signal with the command that matches the outcome:

- progress remains: `octopus issue comment <issue> --body <text> [--image <path>]`
- work is complete: `octopus issue done <issue> --comment <text> [--image <path>]`
- work is blocked: `octopus issue block <issue> --comment <text> [--image <path>]`
- ownership changes: add an explicit handoff comment before or with the assignee update

If the issue has a reviewer, `issue done` means the assignee is ready for
review. The control plane moves the issue to `in_review` and wakes the
reviewer agent when `reviewerAgentId` is configured; only
`octopus issue review --decision approve` marks the issue done. A
`reviewerUserId` assignment enters human review without creating an agent run.
Without either reviewer field, `issue done` marks the issue `done` directly,
and a direct attempt to set `in_review` is rejected.

If an issue has a reviewer, moving it to `blocked` is also a reviewer handoff: the reviewer should confirm the blocker, request changes, approve, or keep explicit follow-up open with `octopus issue review`.

`--image` may be repeated. The CLI uploads each local PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF as an issue attachment and appends Markdown image links to the comment text before sending it.

If your issue comment cites a screenshot path or visual validation artifact, attach that file with `--image <path>` instead of leaving only the local path in the text.

If `OCTOPUS_WAKE_REASON=issue_passive_followup`, the run is close-out governance for the same issue. Inspect current issue state first, then leave a progress comment, completion, blocker, or explicit handoff.

## Git Identity Policy

Local runtime `HOME` is isolated from the operator home. Codex local runs and runtime-created git worktrees are prepared with `user.useConfigOnly=true` so missing identity fails fast instead of producing `*@*.local` commits. If Git reports missing author or committer identity, configure the repository explicitly with `git config user.name <name>` and `git config user.email <safe-email>`; do not unset the guard or accept auto-detected local-host metadata.

## Reviewer Close-Out Signals

When the inbox row or wake context says `relationship: "reviewer"`, `role: "reviewer"`, or `wakeSource: "review"`, finish the review with one structured reviewer decision. Reviewer work can be either `in_review` or `blocked`; blocked reviewer work means blocker triage, not implementation takeover.

- approve: `octopus issue review <issue> --decision approve --comment <text>`
- request changes: `octopus issue review <issue> --decision request_changes --comment <text>`
- needs follow-up: `octopus issue review <issue> --decision needs_followup --comment <text>`
- blocked or blocker confirmed: `octopus issue review <issue> --decision blocked --comment <text>`; use this only for a confirmed human/external blocker and name the next human action.

Do not rely on a free-form reject or accept comment as the review outcome. The structured decision is the durable close-out signal. A blocked reviewer decision records a human handoff and removes the issue from repeated reviewer pickup until the board changes the issue.

## Compatibility Commands

- `octopus agent list --org-id <id>` — List agents for an organization.
- `octopus agent get <agent-id-or-shortname>` — Read one agent by id or shortname.
- `octopus agent hire --org-id <id> --payload <json>` — Create a new hire using the canonical hire workflow.
- `octopus agent config index` — Read the installed agent runtime configuration index.
- `octopus agent config doc <agent-runtime-type>` — Read adapter-specific configuration guidance for one runtime.
- `octopus agent config list --org-id <id>` — List redacted agent configuration snapshots for an organization.
- `octopus agent config get <agent-id-or-shortname>` — Read one redacted agent configuration snapshot by id or shortname.
- `octopus agent icons` — List legacy named agent icons for compatibility/debugging; normal create and hire payloads should omit icon.
- `octopus issue create --org-id <id> --title <title> [--description <text>|--body <text>] ... [--label-id <id> ...] [--label <name> ...]` — Create one standalone issue with the generic issue surface.
- `octopus issue create-children <parent> (--children-file <UTF-8 JSON file> | --children-json '<JSON array>')` — Persist the complete delegated child set atomically. Prefer `--children-file` to avoid shell escaping problems. Each child requires `title` and `assigneeAgentId`; optional fields are `description`, `priority`, and `reviewerAgentId`. A retry returns the already persisted child set instead of creating another set. Never test with a placeholder child on a real parent, and do not include a summary/report child; the parent continuation owns final synthesis.
- `octopus issue labels list --org-id <id>` — List organization issue labels available for issue creation.
- `octopus approval create --org-id <id> --type <type> --payload <json>` — Create a new approval request.
- `octopus approval resubmit <approval-id> [--payload <json>]` — Resubmit a revision-requested approval, optionally with updated payload.
