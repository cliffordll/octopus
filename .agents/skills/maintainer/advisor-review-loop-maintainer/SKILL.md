  Run a decision-grade advisor-to-reviewer loop for Octopus development work.
  Use this skill when the user asks to combine Build Advisor with Agent Work
  Reviewer Maintainer, wants first-principles scenario and requirement analysis
  plus an independent reviewer loop or acceptance gate, asks for two reviewer
  agents, says "迭代两轮", "没有通过 review 返工", "从场景和需求出发",
  "corner cases", or needs a proposal, skill, workflow, UI, architecture,
  release review, or agent outcome to survive independent review before final
  handoff. Prefer plain build-advisor for first-principles advice that does not
  require reviewer agents, repeated review rounds, or acceptance gating.

# Advisor Review Loop Maintainer

This skill chains two existing Octopus maintainer practices:

- `build-advisor`: turn fuzzy dissatisfaction or a high-stakes request into a
  grounded scenario analysis, requirement map, options, and recommended plan.
- `agent-work-reviewer-maintainer`: independently judge whether the result
  solved the right product problem with sufficient behavior, evidence, and
  validation.

Use this skill when the work should not be accepted after one author pass. The
goal is to create a reviewable proposal or implementation, expose it to
independent pressure, revise it, and only hand off once the remaining risk is
explicit.

## When To Use

Use this skill for Octopus development tasks where the user asks for any of:

- Build Advisor followed by reviewer agents
- first-principles product, scenario, or requirement analysis that must pass
  independent reviewers, repeated review rounds, or an explicit acceptance gate
- deep corner-case coverage before implementation or handoff
- two review iterations before the final answer
- "no pass, keep reworking" behavior
- review of a plan, skill, workflow, feature, UI, architecture, release
  verification, or completed agent task where correctness depends on product
  judgment and an acceptance gate

Do not use this skill for a narrow bug fix, simple command, ordinary code
review, direct release execution, or a generic first-principles advisory task
where the correct specialized skill can execute directly.

If the user explicitly names this skill for a narrow screenshot-driven UI fix
but does not ask for reviewer agents, repeated rounds, "no pass then rework",
or an acceptance gate, use the lightweight route:

1. Do a short advisor check to confirm the UI problem and non-goals.
2. Hand the implementation to `octopus-ui-polish-maintainer` discipline.
3. Report that this was a lightweight advisor route, not a full reviewer loop.

Do not spend a full two-reviewer loop on small color, spacing, label, icon,
badge, menu-position, or redundant-wrapper fixes unless the user explicitly
asks for that review bar.

## Inputs

Resolve these before starting:

- Target artifact: proposal, plan doc, skill, code diff, PR, commit, release,
  UI state, transcript, or workflow.
- Requested mode: proposal-only, implementation, review-only, or
  proposal-then-implementation.
- Evidence source: repo files, docs, screenshots, logs, traces, commits,
  branches, PRs, eval outputs, or user-provided artifacts.
- Review bar: what must be true before the result can be accepted.

If the user is explicit, infer reasonable defaults and proceed. Ask only when
the target artifact or requested mode cannot be determined safely.

Respect `review-only` strictly. In review-only mode, produce the advisor frame,
review findings, verdicts, and smallest changes needed, but do not edit files,
rewrite the artifact, or continue into implementation unless the user
explicitly asks for rework after seeing the findings.

When the conversation resumes after a `turn_aborted`, `/goal`, or a long-running
implementation checkpoint, rebuild the current state before continuing:

- inspect branch and dirty state
- identify partial commits, merge/conflict state, and running verification
- restate the remaining task list and proof still missing

Do not assume the previous turn finished cleanly just because the next user
message says to continue.

## Default Workflow

### 1. Build the evidence packet

Collect the smallest set of evidence that can support real judgment:

- repo instructions and relevant docs
- current branch, dirty state, commits, PRs, or target files
- existing plans, specs, screenshots, traces, or eval results
- the two source skills when this workflow depends on their contracts:
  `.agents/skills/build-advisor/SKILL.md` and
  `.agents/skills/maintainer/agent-work-reviewer-maintainer/SKILL.md`

For Octopus product or workflow work, read the relevant subset of
`doc/GOAL.md`, `doc/PRODUCT.md`, `doc/SPEC-implementation.md`, and
`doc/DESIGN.md` when UI is involved.

Keep the packet focused. Do not scan the whole repository just to look busy.

### 2. Run the advisor pass

Follow the `build-advisor` discipline before drafting or accepting the target:

- reframe what the user is actually trying to accomplish
- diagnose the primary layer of the problem
- map actors, lifecycle states, intents, and failure modes
- collapse scenarios into requirement classes
- identify non-goals and boundaries
- cover corner cases that could change the design
- define a concrete evaluation rubric
- compare realistic options
- expand the recommended option into a decision-ready artifact

Do not claim literal "100% certainty." Instead, state the coverage boundary:
what scenarios were considered, what evidence supports them, and what new
evidence would change the conclusion.

### 3. Spawn two independent reviewer agents

When subagents are available and the user asked for reviewer agents, spawn both
reviewers in the same turn so they evaluate independently. Record the review
execution mode as `spawned reviewers`.

Reviewer A owns scenario and demand correctness:

```text
Use .agents/skills/maintainer/agent-work-reviewer-maintainer/SKILL.md.

Review this artifact from first principles as the scenario and demand reviewer.
Focus on actors, user jobs, lifecycle states, requirement classes, non-goals,
corner cases, and whether the proposed solution solves the right product
problem. Give accept / conditional accept / reject, blocking gaps, and the
smallest changes needed to pass.
```

Reviewer B owns delivery and trust correctness:

```text
Use .agents/skills/maintainer/agent-work-reviewer-maintainer/SKILL.md.

Review this artifact as the implementation, workflow, and validation reviewer.
Focus on object model, scope discipline, org scoping, contracts, validation,
tests, UI evidence when relevant, rollback/recovery, and handoff quality. Give
accept / conditional accept / reject, blocking gaps, and the smallest changes
needed to pass.
```

Include the same evidence packet, target artifact, user request, and evaluation
rubric in both prompts. Tell reviewers they are not implementers; they should
judge and identify gaps.

If subagents are unavailable, run the two reviews serially yourself. Record the
review execution mode as `serial two-role fallback`, do not claim that two
agents were spawned, and treat independence confidence as lower. Keep the roles
separate and label them so the author pass does not silently grade itself.

### 4. Merge findings into a rework list

After both reviews return:

- normalize verdicts into `accept`, `conditional accept`, `reject`, or
  `needs more evidence`
- separate blocking gaps from non-blocking suggestions
- identify reviewer disagreements and decide which requirement owns the tie
- revise the artifact only for gaps that improve correctness or evidence
- avoid overfitting to one reviewer phrasing when a more general skill,
  workflow, or product rule is needed

In `review-only` mode, stop here with the merged findings and smallest rework
list. Do not revise the artifact or run another round unless the user explicitly
switches from review to rework.

If either reviewer rejects the artifact or names a blocking gap, do not hand off
as final. Rework first.

### 5. Run a second review round

For high-stakes tasks, skill creation, workflow changes, or when the user asks
for two iterations, run a second reviewer round after the first revision.

The second-round prompt should include:

- the revised artifact
- round-one findings
- a short change log explaining what was changed
- explicit request to judge whether blockers were actually resolved

If round two still produces a rejection or unresolved blocker, do another
targeted rework and repeat the review loop until either:

- both reviewers accept or conditionally accept with no blocking gaps
- the remaining gap requires new user judgment or external evidence
- continued iteration is no longer producing meaningful improvement

### 6. Final handoff

The final answer should be compact but must include:

- final artifact path or summary
- review execution mode: spawned reviewers or serial two-role fallback
- advisor coverage boundary: scenarios, requirements, non-goals, and key corner
  cases considered
- reviewer round summaries and verdicts
- what changed between rounds
- validation performed and what remains unverified
- residual risks or decisions that still need human judgment

If code, docs, or skills changed, follow repository validation, commit, and
push rules. Keep unrelated dirty worktree changes out of the commit. For skill
changes, at minimum validate JSON eval files and report whether any eval harness
or benchmark viewer was run; if not run, say why.

## Review Acceptance Bar

Treat the result as not ready when any of these are true:

- the artifact starts from implementation shape rather than user job and
  scenario pressure
- requirement classes do not trace back to scenarios or failure modes
- reviewer prompts lack the evidence packet, causing shallow opinion review
- reviewers are asked to rubber-stamp instead of reject when needed
- the second round does not explicitly verify that first-round blockers were
  fixed
- user-visible workflow changes lack E2E or rendered evidence where the repo
  requires it
- the final handoff does not disclose whether review used spawned subagents or
  a serial fallback
- the handoff hides skipped checks or presents unverified behavior as proven

## Common Corner Cases

- Reviewer disagreement: prefer the finding tied to a concrete user scenario,
  repo invariant, or validation gap. If both are plausible, keep the issue open
  as a human decision instead of pretending consensus exists.
- Missing evidence: switch the verdict to `needs more evidence`; collect the
  missing artifact before another review when possible.
- User asked for proposal only: stop at a proposal artifact and review it. Do
  not begin implementation without confirmation.
- User asked for review only: stop at verdicts and smallest changes needed. Do
  not rework the artifact until the user asks you to switch into rework.
- User asked for implementation: write the plan only when repo rules require
  it, implement after the advisor pass, then review the actual diff and
  validation evidence.
- Narrow UI fix with this skill explicitly invoked: use the lightweight route,
  then follow `octopus-ui-polish-maintainer` for implementation, visual proof,
  tests, commit, and handoff.
- Skill creation: create the skill in the correct global or project-local
  location, add realistic eval prompts when useful, and review trigger
  description, workflow, references, and evalability.
- Visible UI: include screenshot or browser evidence before claiming the loop
  passed.
- Release or Desktop work: validate live release surfaces or packaged behavior;
  local build success is not enough.

## Output Template

Use this structure when reporting the loop:

```markdown
结论：...

产物：
- ...

Advisor 覆盖：
- 场景/角色：...
- 需求类：...
- 非目标：...
- 关键 corner cases：...

Review 轮次：
- Round 1: Reviewer A ..., Reviewer B ...
- Round 2: Reviewer A ..., Reviewer B ...
- Execution mode: spawned reviewers / serial two-role fallback

返工摘要：

```

Keep the final response shorter when the work is small, but do not omit failed
checks or unresolved blockers.
